This image serves as the base image for all OpenShift v3 S2I builder images.
It provides all essential libraries and development tools needed to
successfully build and run an application.

To use this image as a base image, you need to have 's2i/bin' directory in the
same directory as your S2I image Dockerfile. This directory should contain S2I
scripts.

This base image also provides the default user you should use to run your
application. Your Dockerfile should include this instruction after you finish
installing software:

USER default

The default directory for installing your application sources is
'/opt/app-root/src' and the WORKDIR and HOME for the 'default' user is set
to this directory as well. In your S2I scripts, you don't have to use absolute
path, but rather rely on the relative path.
